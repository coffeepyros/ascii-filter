# ASCII FILTER

-   Takes an image and extracts luminance and color data
-   uses this data to create a new image drawn entirely with ascii characters

## ToDo

-   create 2nd canvas, draw image in there, use data from second canvas to power generation of 1st image
-   somehow hide 2nd canvas in the whole process

## Ideas

-   use webcam in browser to capture image and transform it into ascii art
